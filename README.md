# Amazon_ecommerce_analysis

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of Amazon product listings and sales, with the objective of identifying factors that influence product performance, pricing, and customer ratings. The aim was to combine statistical exploration in R with interactive visualization in Power BI to generate a comprehensive view of Amazonâ€™s marketplace dynamics.

### Work in R:
Performed extensive data cleaning and preprocessing, which included handling missing values, standardizing discount percentages, and converting categorical features into analyzable formats. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand relationships between product prices, discounts, ratings, and number of reviews. Built multiple regression models to study how variables like price and discount levels impact ratings and buying patterns. Visualized distributions and correlation patterns in R, helping to frame the structure of insights before moving to visualization.

### Work in Power BI:

Built an interactive dashboard to summarize and visualize product metrics. Added KPI cards showing total products, unique categories, number of bestsellers, and categories with discounts above 90%. Designed a price band table and a discount band treemap to illustrate product distribution across pricing and discount ranges. Created a recent purchases analysis chart, combining average rating, average discount, and average price with dual-axis visualization. Added slicers for bestseller status and rating bands to allow interactive exploration.
